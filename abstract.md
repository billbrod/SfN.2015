Cognition and Behavior -- Human Cognition and Behavior -- Decision making and reasoning

#Abstract#

The majority of human interactions with each other require the
understanding of others' actions and intentions, and the use of this
engagement when making decisions or formulating strategies. However,
engagement in a given task under a given set of conditions is far from
uniform and measure it typically requires a long period of time. In
this study, we used a competitive game-playing task, wherein subjects
controlled the ball in a simplified penalty kick against a human or
computer goalie, to investigate engagement over a single trial. We
predict that trials where participants were more engaged will be
reliably differentiable from those where they were less engaged with
their opponents, with different patterns of activation found in the
Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) and ... **(?)**. Using clustering and
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we have found trials can be
understood as lying along two major axes: position at final time point
and y-separation from goalie. These dimensions can be used as proxies
for engagement with the opponent: did the player controlling the ball
start the trial with a strategy or are they just reacting to the
goalie's movements? We predict that activation in relevant social
areas, such as the TPJ, can be classified into categories based on
these trial-wise measures.

Questions:

* How mention prefrontal cortex?
* I have definitely lost sight of the big picture of this study...
* Feel like I should play up MVPA more...
* I guess I'm not sure that separation can actually be used as a proxy for engagement
* And how about deception?
