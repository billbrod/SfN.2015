Cognition and Behavior -- Human Cognition and Behavior -- Decision making and reasoning

#Abstract#

The majority of human interactions require the understanding of
others' actions and intentions -- a process commonly labeled as social
cognition or theory of mind -- which then feeds into the strategic
control of behavior and decision making. Most such tasks... static or
sequential interactions; social network, notably the temporal-parietal
junction (TPJ). Here, we adapted a dynamic competitive game... wherein
human subjects controlled the ball in a simplified penalty kick
against a human or computer opponent, while measures of brain
activation were obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). *This allows classification of participant behavior*... XX and
k-means clustering revealed that participant behavior classified
(reduced?) into two pairs of clusters, one pair representing early
deception (i.e., separation between participant and opponent near the
start of the trial) and another pair representing late deception
(i.e., separation at the end of the trial). These cluster pairs -- each
further separable into upward or downward movements -- correspond to
distinct strategies in behavior based on analyses of time courses and
xx. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we examined whether
local brain regions carried information that predicted trial features
(e.g., opponent, outcome, deception strategy). We found that...
[human vs. computer result]. Using this dynamic task allows
distinction of strategic elements of deception (e.g., timing of
movement) from the conditions that elicit deception, the nature of the
opponent, and the outcome of the action. Accordingly, the use of
dynamic tasks can reveal new information about the online processing
that shapes social deception.

Still need:

* "XX and kmeans" to "looking at relative y position ..." or something like that
* one-sentence summary for task
* why does it matter that it's **our** task, why's it better than others
* Task is a deception task, but can you use other words to describe
  the behaviors revealed by our cluster, like along the lines of
  "strategies intended to..."
