Cognition and Behavior -- Human Cognition and Behavior -- Decision making and reasoning

#Abstract#

Successful human interactions depend upon the interpretation of an
agent's behaviors and intentions in order to support strategic control
of the agent's behaviors and decisions. Interpreting others' actions
requires many elements of social cognition, including more complex
functions like theory of mind. Although there is some consistency in
the neural substrates identified as supporting these functions
(e.g. the medial-prefrontal cortex and temporal-parietal junction,
TPJ), most tasks employ static or sequential interactions that do not
allow investigation of differing levels of social-cognitive engagement
on a short time scale. In this study, we adapted a dynamic,
competitive game modeled on a simplified penalty kick, wherein humans
($N=29$) controlled a ball, attempting to score against a human- or
computer-controlled goalie, while measures of brain activation were
obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This
allowed us to quantitatively characterize subjects' strategic
interactions with their opponent -- and how these strategies change
over short and longer time scales. K-means clustering on the
difference between the y position of the subject-controlled ball and
human-controlled goalie revealed that participant behavior reduced to
two clusters, one pair representing early feints and misdirections
(i.e., separation between participant and opponent near the start of
the trial) and the other representing strategies intended to hide the
kicker's intention for as long as possible (i.e., separation only at
the end of the trial). These clusters -- each further separable into
pairs of upward or downward movements -- correspond to distinct
behavioral strategies. Play against a computer opponent served as a
non-social baseline with similar strategic interactions. Using
multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we examined whether local brain
regions carried information that predicted trial features (e.g.,
opponent, outcome, strategy). Confirmatory analyses found that visual
regions can be used to classify human from computer opponents at the
time the opponent is revealed. MVPA of strategic interaction focused
on the neural response differences between the two strategy-defined
clusters. Using this dynamic task allows distinction of strategic
elements of deception (e.g., timing of movement) from the conditions
that elicit deception, the nature of the opponent, and the outcome of
the action. The use of dynamic tasks facilitates the study of
strategic social interaction on short timescales, opening avenues for
causal studies of the supporting neural substrates.
