Cognition and Behavior -- Human Cognition and Behavior -- Decision making and reasoning

#Abstract#

Most successful human interactions depend upon the interpretation of a contact’s behaviors and intentions in order to support strategic control of the actor’s behaviors and decisions. Interpreting other’s actions require many elements of social cognition including more complex functions like theory of mind. Although there is some consistency in the neural substrates identified as supporting these functions (e.g. the medial-prefrontal cortex and temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)), these interactions are difficult to study on a short time scale. Most tasks employ static or long sequential interactions that do not allow one to investigate differing levels of social-cognitive engagement over short time scales. In this
study, we adapted a dynamic, competitive game wherein human subjects
controlled the ball in a simplified penalty kick against a human- or
computer-controlled goalie, while measures of brain activation were
obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This
allowed us to carry out detailed investigation of subjects'
interactions with their opponent, the strategies they employ, and how
relevant factors change over time on both short and longer time
scales. K-means clustering on the difference between the y position of
the subject-controlled ball and their human opponent revealed that
participant behavior reduced to two clusters, one
pair representing early feints and misdirections**
(i.e., separation between participant and opponent near the start of
the trial) and another representing strategies intended to hide the kicker’s
intention for as long as possible (i.e., separation only at the end
of the trial). These clusters -- each further separable into pairs of
upward or downward movements -- correspond to distinct strategies in
behavior based **only on analyses of behavioral time courses**. Using
multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we examined whether local brain
regions carried information that predicted trial features (e.g.,
opponent, outcome, deception strategy). Confirmatory analyses found
that visual regions can be used to classify human from computer opponents at the time the opponent is revealed. MVPA of strategic interaction focused on the neural response difference between early and late behavioral clusters. Using this dynamic task allows
distinction of strategic elements of deception (e.g., timing of
movement) from the conditions that elicit deception, the nature of the
opponent, and the outcome of the action. The use of dynamic tasks facilitates the study of the nature and characteristics of strategic social interaction on short timescales opening avenues for causal studies of the supporting neural substrates.

* Human v computer result currently shows best classification in
  occipital cortex and FFA, since we're doing it at the time point
  when the opponent's picture is shown. I'm not sure this is an
  interesting result to mention...
