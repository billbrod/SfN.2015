Cognition and Behavior -- Human Cognition and Behavior -- Decision making and reasoning

#Abstract#

The majority of human interactions require the understanding of
others' actions and intentions -- a process commonly labeled as social
cognition or theory of mind -- which then feeds into the strategic
control of behavior and decision making. Most such tasks employ static
or sequential interactions, which show the engagement of the social
network, notably the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ). They do not,
however, allow one to investigate differing levels of
**[social cognition / engagement]** over short time scales. In this
study, we adapted a dynamic, competitive game wherein human subjects
controlled the ball in a simplified penalty kick against a human- or
computer-controlled goalie, while measures of brain activation were
obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This
allowed us to carry out detailed investigation of subjects'
interactions with their opponent, the strategies they employ, and how
all relevant factors change over time on both large and small
scales. K-means clustering on the difference between the y position of
the subject-controlled ball and their human opponent revealed that
participant behavior naturally reduced to two pairs of clusters, one
pair representing **strategies involving feints and misdirection**
(i.e., separation between participant and opponent near the start of
the trial) and another pair representing **strategies intended to hide
intention for as long as possible** (i.e., separation only at the end
of the trial). These cluster pairs -- each further separable into
upward or downward movements -- correspond to distinct strategies in
behavior based **only on analyses of behavioral time courses**. Using
multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we examined whether local brain
regions carried information that predicted trial features (e.g.,
opponent, outcome, deception strategy). We found
that ... **[human v computer result]**. Using this dynamic task allows
distinction of strategic elements of deception (e.g., timing of
movement) from the conditions that elicit deception, the nature of the
opponent, and the outcome of the action. Accordingly, the use of
dynamic tasks can reveal new information about the online processing
that shapes social deception.

* Human v computer result currently shows best classification in
  occipital cortex and FFA, since we're doing it at the time point
  when the opponent's picture is shown. I'm not sure this is an
  interesting result to mention...
